Our group performs theoretical calculations relevant to nuclear and
  hadron physics within the theory of
  quarks and gluons, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We have a
  particular interest in the numerical technique known as <i>lattice
  QCD</i>. We mentor postdoctoral researchers and graduate and undergraduate
  students pursuing research in nuclear theory, and we maintain a
  close connection with the nearby Jefferson Lab, where we are members
  of the Theory Center.

      <h2>  
        Congratulations to our graduate students
      </h2>
      <p>
       Group members Felipe Ortega, Chris Johnson and Colin Egerer all
      have reason to celebrate. Felipe was recently awarded a W&amp;M
      International Student Achievement Award recognizing his
      explemary performance in academics and his tireless service to
      the college. Chris Johnson and Colin Egerer, who will both
      defend in the summer, have been offered postdoctoral positions
      at world leading centers for hadron physics. Chris will go to 
      GSI in Darmstadt, Germany, and Colin to Jefferson Lab, where
      they will continue their research efforts in lattice QCD.

      <p>
The dependence of S-wave and P-wave $\pi K$ scattering on the mass of
      the light quark is studied in lattice QCD. The narrow vector
      $K^*$ resonance is observed clearly, becoming lighter and
      broader as the quark mass is reduced, while a slowly varying
      phase-shift is seen in S-wave.
